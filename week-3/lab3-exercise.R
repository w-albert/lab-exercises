#Get all rows of Species ‘versicolor’ in a new data frame. Call this data frame: ‘iris.vers’

#Get a vector called ‘sepal.dif’ with the difference between ‘Sepal.Length’ and ‘Sepal.Width’ of ‘versicolor’ plants.

#Add ‘iris.vers’ with the new column ‘sepal.dif’.

#filter for all data of Species ‘virginica’ with a ‘Sepal.Width’ of greater than 3.5.

#get a data frame of  all data of Species ‘setosa’ with a ‘Sepal.Width’ of greater than 3.5, but without the last column Species in the data frame?

#Write a function that takes in a species name as an argument and returns the average Sepal Width of that species.

#What is the average Sepal.Length for 'versicolor' species having a Petal.Length of 4.2 or higher?

#BONUS VIZ Q
# Visualize species, Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width in a single plot. DO YOU SEE CLUSTERS?



#ULTRA BONUS - PERFORM PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND PLOT CLUSTERS
